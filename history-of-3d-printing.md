# History of 3d Printing

#### The 1950s

The general concept of and procedure to be used in 3D-printing was first described by Raymond F. Jones in his story, "Tools of the Trade," published in the November 1950 issue of Astounding Science Fiction magazine. He referred to it as a "molecular spray" in that story.

#### The 1970s

In 1971, Johannes F Gottwald patented the Liquid Metal Recorder, US3596285A, a continuous Inkjet metal material device to form a removable metal fabrication on a reusable surface for immediate use or salvaged for printing again by remelting. This appears to be the first patent describing 3D printing with rapid prototyping and controlled on-demand manufacturing of patterns.

The patent states " As used herein the term printing" is not intended in a limited sense but includes writing or other symbols, character, or pattern formation with an ink. The term ink as used in is intended to include not only dye or pigment-containing materials, but any flowable substance or composition suited for application to the surface for forming symbols, characters, or patterns of intelligence by marking". The preferred ink is of a Hot melt" type. The range of commercially available ink compositions which could meet the requirements of the invention is not known at the present time. However, satisfactory printing according to the invention has been achieved with the conductive metal alloy as ink."

"But in terms of material requirements for such large and continuous displays, if consumed at theretofore known rates, but increased in proportion to increase in size, the high cost would severely limit any widespread enjoyment of a process or apparatus satisfying the foregoing objects."

"It is, therefore, an additional object of the invention to minimize use to materials in a process of the indicated class."

"It is a further object of the invention that materials employed in such a process be salvaged for reuse."

"According to another aspect of the invention, a combination for writing and the like comprises a carrier for displaying an intelligence pattern and an arrangement for removing the pattern from the carrier."

In 1974, [David E. H. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_E._H._Jones) laid out the concept of 3D printing in his regular column Ariadne in the journal New Scientist.

#### The 1980s

Early additive manufacturing equipment and materials were developed in the 1980s.

In April 1980, Hideo Kodama of [Nagoya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya) Municipal Industrial Research Institute invented two additive methods for fabricating three-dimensional plastic models with photo-hardening thermoset polymer, where the UV exposure area is controlled by a mask pattern or a scanning fiber transmitter. He filed a patent for this XYZ plotter, which was published on 10 November 1981. His research results as journal papers were published in April and November in 1981. However, there was no reaction to the series of his publications. His device was not highly evaluated in the laboratory and his boss did not show any interest. His research budget was just 60,000 yen or $545 a year. Acquiring the patent rights for the XYZ plotter was abandoned, and the project was terminated.

A Patent US 4323756, Method of Fabricating Articles by Sequential Deposition, Raytheon Technologies Corp granted 6 April 1982 using hundreds or thousands of 'layers' of powdered metal and a laser energy source is an early reference to forming "layers" and the fabrication of articles on a substrate.

On 2 July 1984, American entrepreneur [Bill Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_%28Bill%29_Masters) filed a patent for his Computer Automated Manufacturing Process and System. This filing is on record at the [USPTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office) as the first 3D printing patent in history; it was the first of three patents belonging to Masters that laid the foundation for the 3D printing systems used today.

On 16 July 1984, [Alain Le Méhauté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Le_Mehaute), Olivier de Witte, and Jean Claude André filed their patent for the [stereolithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography) process. The application of the French inventors was abandoned by the French General Electric Company \(now Alcatel-Alsthom\) and [CILAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CILAS) \(The Laser Consortium\). The claimed reason was "for lack of business perspective".

In 1983, Robert Howard started R.H. Research, later named Howtek, Inc. in Feb 1984 to develop a color inkjet 2D printer, Pixelmaster, commercialized in 1986, using Thermoplastic \(hot-melt\) plastic ink. A team was put together, 6 members from Exxon Office Systems, Danbury Systems Division, an inkjet printer startup, and some members of the Howtek, Inc group who became popular figures in the 3D Printing Industry. One Howtek member, Richard Helinski patent US5136515A, Method and Means for constructing three-dimensional articles by particle deposition, application 11/07/1989 granted 8/04/1992 formed a New Hampshire company C.A.D-Cast, Inc, name later changed to Visual Impact Corporation \(VIC\) on 8/22/1991. A prototype of the VIC 3D printer for this company is available with a video presentation showing a 3D model printed with a single nozzle inkjet. Another employee Herbert Menhennett formed a New Hampshire company HM Research in 1991 and introduced Howtek, Inc, inkjet technology, and thermoplastic materials to Royden Sanders of SDI and Bill Masters of Ballistic Particle Manufacturing \(BPM\) where he worked for a number of years. Both BPM 3D printers and SPI 3D printers use Howtek, Inc style Inkjets and Howtek, Inc style materials. Royden Sanders licensed the Helinksi patent prior to manufacturing the Modelmaker 6 Pro at Sanders prototype, Inc \(SPI\) in 1993. James K. McMahon who was hired by Howtek, Inc to help develop the inkjet, later worked at Sanders Prototype and now operates Layer Grown Model Technology, a 3D service provider specializing in Howtek single nozzle inkjet and SDI printer support. James K. McMahon worked with Steven Zoltan, 1972 drop-on-demand inkjet inventor, at Exxon and has a patent in 1978 that expanded the understanding of the single nozzle design inkjets\( Alpha jets\) and help perfect the Howtek, Inc hot-melt inkjets. This Howtek hot-melt thermoplastic technology is popular with metal investment casting, especially in the 3D printing jewelry industry. Sanders \(SDI\) first Modelmaker 6Pro customer was Hitchner Corporations, Metal Casting Technology, Inc in Milford, NH a mile from the SDI facility in late 1993-1995 casting golf clubs and auto engine parts.

On 8 August 1984 a patent, US4575330, assigned to UVP, Inc., later assigned to [Chuck Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Hull) of [3D Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Systems) Corporation was filed, his own patent for a stereolithography fabrication system, in which individual laminae or layers are added by curing [photopolymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopolymers) with impinging radiation, particle bombardment, chemical reaction or just ultraviolet light lasers. Hull defined the process as a "system for generating three-dimensional objects by creating a cross-sectional pattern of the object to be formed". Hull's contribution was the STL \(Stereolithography\) file format and the digital slicing and infill strategies common to many processes today. In 1986, Charles "Chuck" Hull was granted a patent for this system, and his company, 3D Systems Corporation was formed and it released the first commercial 3D printer, the SLA-1 later in 1987 or 1988.

The technology used by most 3D printers to date—especially hobbyist and consumer-oriented models—is fused deposition modeling, a special application of plastic extrusion, developed in 1988 by [S. Scott Crump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Scott_Crump) and commercialized by his company [Stratasys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratasys), which marketed its first FDM machine in 1992.

Owning a 3D printer in the 1980’s cost upwards of $300k. If we account for inflation as of 2016 that price would be $650k. Over time this price dropped due to the consumer wants and production of more printers as well as innovation in the product.

#### The 1990s

AM processes for metal sintering or melting \(such as [selective laser sintering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering), [direct metal laser sintering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_metal_laser_sintering), and selective laser melting\) usually went by their own individual names in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that are now called non-additive \(casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining\); although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies \(such as by robot welding and [CNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control)\), the idea of a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape with a toolpath was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal \(rather than adding it\), such as CNC milling, CNC EDM, and many others. But the automated techniques that added metal, which would later be called additive manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including micro casting and sprayed materials. Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common, enabling new object geometries.

The term 3D printing originally referred to a powder bed process employing standard and custom inkjet print heads, developed at MIT by Emanuel Sachs in 1993 and commercialized by Soligen Technologies, Extrude Hone Corporation, and Z Corporation.

The year 1993 also saw the start of an inkjet 3D printer company initially named Sanders Prototype, Inc and later named [Solidscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidscape), introducing a high-precision polymer jet fabrication system with soluble support structures, \(categorized as a "dot-on-dot" technique\).

In 1995 the [Fraunhofer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society) developed the [selective laser melting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_melting) process.

#### The 2000s

Fused Deposition Modeling \(FDM\) printing process patents expired in 2009.

#### The 2010s

As the various additive processes matured, it became clear that soon metal removal would no longer be the only metalworking process done through a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope, transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer. The 2010s were the first decade in which metal end-use parts such as engine brackets and large nuts would be grown \(either before or instead of machining\) in job production rather than obligately being machined from bar stock or plate. It is still the case that casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining are more prevalent than additive manufacturing in metalworking, but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads, and with the advantages of design for additive manufacturing, it is clear to engineers that much more is to come.

One place that AM is making significant inroads is in the aviation industry. With nearly 3.8 billion air travelers in 2016, the demand for fuel-efficient and easily produced jet engines has never been higher. For large OEMs \(original equipment manufacturers\) like Pratt and Whitney \(PW\) and General Electric \(GE\), this means looking towards AM as a way to reduce cost, reduce the number of nonconforming parts, reduce weight in the engines to increase fuel efficiency, and find new, highly complex shapes that would not be feasible with the antiquated manufacturing methods. One example of AM integration with aerospace was in 2016 when Airbus was delivered the first of GE’s LEAP engine. This engine has integrated 3D printed fuel nozzles giving them a reduction in parts from 20 to 1, a 25% weight reduction, and reduced assembly times. A fuel nozzle is a perfect inroad for additive manufacturing in a jet engine since it allows for optimized design of the complex internals and it is a low stress, non-rotating part. Similarly, in 2015, PW delivered their first AM parts in the PurePower PW1500G to Bombardier. Sticking to low-stress, non-rotating parts, PW selected the compressor stators and synch ring brackets to roll out this new manufacturing technology for the first time. While AM is still playing a small role in the total number of parts in the jet engine manufacturing process, the return on investment can already be seen by the reduction in parts, the rapid production capabilities, and the "optimized design in terms of performance and cost".

As the technology matured, several authors had begun to speculate that 3D printing could aid in sustainable development in the developing world.

In 2012, Filabot developed a system for closing the loop with plastic and allows for any FDM or FFF 3D printer to be able to print with a wider range of plastics.

In 2014, [Benjamin S. Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_S._Cook) and Manos M. Tentzeris demonstrate the first multi-material, vertically integrated printed electronics additive manufacturing platform \(VIPRE\) which enabled 3D printing of functional electronics operating up to 40 GHz.

As the price of printers started to drop people interested in this technology had more access and freedom to make what they wanted. The price as of 2014 was still high with the cost being over $2,000 yet this still allowed hobbyists an entrance into printing outside of production and industry methods.

The term "3D printing" originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer. More recently, the popular vernacular has started using the term to encompass a wider variety of additive-manufacturing techniques such as electron-beam additive manufacturing and selective laser melting. The United States and global technical standards use the official term additive manufacturing for this broader sense.

The most commonly used 3D printing process \(46% as of 2018\) is a material extrusion technique called fused deposition modeling, or FDM. While FDM technology was invented after the other two most popular technologies, stereolithography \(SLA\) and selective laser sintering \(SLS\), FDM is typically the most inexpensive of the three by a large margin, which lends to the popularity of the process.

#### 2020

As of 2020, 3D printers have reached the level of quality and price that allows most people to enter the world of 3D printing. In 2020 decent quality printers can be found for less than US$200 for entry-level machines. These more affordable printers are usually FDM \(Fused Deposition Modeling\) printers.
