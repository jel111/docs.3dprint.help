# First Print!

Ready to move forward with your first print? That's great but first, make sure to go over the steps on the [First Steps](first-steps-to-3d-printing.md) page. All good? Let's go.

The very first thing we need once our printer is good to go is a suitable model. Normally on the sd card which comes with your machine, there are a few test prints. I had bought the Ender 3 Pro so I printed the cat first thing. Another popular model is the infamous Benchy. You can find that model [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2404462). Let's go to that link on Thingiverse and there is a download button for the file we need. Hit that button, donate if you'd like. We now go to the downloads folder and extract the files from the zip file we downloaded. Find the benchy.stl. The stl file is what we need to slice or turn into a g-code file the printer can read. We import that file into our slicer application. I personally use Simplify 3d but most people use Cura. Once we slice that file we get a g-code file and paste that file onto our sd card. If you are printing a file already on the card you can obviously skip the previous step. 

Now that we have accomplished slicing the model and copying it to the sd card we can remove our card from our computer and install it into the printer. Look at your manual where the slot is located as it is in many different places on these machines. Mostly on the front somewhere. At this point, we turn the machine on and wait for it to boot up, then navigate to Print from card or TF and click that. In that section, you should see your file and click that to print. 

Now the printer should heat up the bed and then the hot end to our specified temp. Once that is finished it will start to print. What we want to do at this point is make sure the print is sticking and not just spewing plastic into a knotted mess. If it is laying down nice we can sit there and watch it do its magic. If all went well we let our machine cool down and this allows us to remove the print easier. At this point, you should have your very first print! Congratulations and great job.
