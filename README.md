# 3D Printing Help

### Start 3D **Printing!** 

I first found 3d printing around 5 years ago and was really struck by how many things I could make myself. I jumped on Craigslist in Chicago, where I lived at the time, and searched to get the best deal I could find. Little did I know I had jumped headfirst into a very deep rabbit hole and I am still digging with no end in sight. To some, this may sound scary and turn you off 3d printing but, for people who like to make things _or_ tinker. In the last few years, 3d printing is morphing into the Maker who wants to design and prototype to get things out the door faster leaving the tinkering to people like me who would rather buy an inexpensive machine versus one that is ready to go and has telephone support. Neither type is bad or better I am just with the former group being the cheapo that I am. All fun aside it is a rabbit hole either way but thanks to a thriving community you are not alone. On that note, the answers to our questions are strewn all over the internet and my goal with this Wiki is to bring that knowledge into one central location. 

We do have a few sites that to do this and I am sure there are more but I am going to collect what I think is important. If you would be so kind as to let me know what you think is important by leaving me a note on my newsletter Substack I would greatly appreciate it and while your at it you can subscribe to my [Free Newsletter](https://3dprint.substack.com). It will arrive in your mailbox every week with helpful articles about 3d printing.

My first printer was a Craiglist find for $100. It was partly put together and was inactive for quite some time. I finished putting it together and tried printing a small clip for my iPad pencil but it wouldn't work. I studied and watched videos but still couldn't get it to work. I bought an older Lulzbot AO 101 which is 10 years old now. I fiddled and fussed until I finally broke down and purchased Simplify 3d. I finally got that clip to print! I was hooked. I hope that I can give enough information on one Wiki to help others not take as long as I did to get going. I was very close to giving up. Keep on Printing!
