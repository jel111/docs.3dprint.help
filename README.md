# 3D Printing Help Docs

### Start 3D **Printing!** 

I first found 3d printing around 5 years ago and was really struck by how I could make anything I could dream and design. I jumped on Craigslist and searched for the best deal I could find. Little did I know I had jumped headfirst into a very deep rabbit hole which I am still digging today. To some, this may sound scary and turn you off 3d printing but, for people who like to make things _or_ tinker this is a perfect fit. In the last few years, 3d printing has morphed into the Maker who wants to design, prototype, and tinker and manufacturers trying to get things out the door faster and cheaper. Neither type is bad or better I am just with the former group being the cheapo tinkerer that I am. All fun aside it is a rabbit hole either way but thanks to a thriving community you are not alone. Including this help doc site.

I started this site because it seems to me the answers to my questions are strewn all over the internet and my goal with this Wiki is to bring that knowledge into one central location. There are many sites which have great information and I am sure there are more than I know of but I am going to collect what I think is important. If you would be so kind as to let me know what you think is lacking or needed by leaving me a note on my Substack I would greatly appreciate it. While you're at it subscribe to my [Free Newsletter](https://3dprint.substack.com). It will arrive in your mailbox every week with helpful articles about 3d printing.

We don't have to spend a thousand dollars anymore. My first printer was a Craiglist find for $100. It was partly put together and was inactive for quite some time. I finished putting it together and tried printing a small clip for my iPad pencil but it wouldn't print. I studied and watched videos but still couldn't get it to work. The printer I bought was a ten-year-old Lulzbot AO 101 which the previous owner didn't ever get working. I fiddled and fussed until I finally broke down and purchased [Simplify 3d](https://www.simplify3d.com), a slicer software. I finally got that clip to print and I was hooked. I hope that I can give enough information on this Wiki to help others. My goal is to reduce the time it takes you to get up and printing great models. Every day things get a bit easier but there is still a lot to know especially if you want to get past printing a model made by someone else hoping it works out. I was very close to giving up and I want to make that a thing of the past for as many Makers as I can. Keep on Printing!
