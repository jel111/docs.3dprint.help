Let’s tackle bed leveling today, one of the most important set up procedures in 3D Printing. I quickly went through the process of leveling when I was putting together my first printer because I wanted to get on with printing. It was taking quite a while to get things ready for printing and I was impatient as usual. My printer was in pieces when bought off a sale site and it took me quite a while to assemble it. I had spent multiple hours on this thing and wanted some results. I proceeded to go around the bed with my piece of paper only one time and thought I was good to go. I will say right here and now this is not the step to scrimp on. I now go around the bed ten or more times until it is as perfect as I can get it. I can’t stress enough how important this step is.

##  **I Can’t Stress Enough.**

I will give another example. I was at a Makerspace here in town and a fellow member was talking about how he had his printer for a couple of years and could never get it to print properly. It is an Ender 3 clone the SainSmart version. I offered to help him reassemble it and we got to work. It took us around two hours including leveling the bed. We started it up ran a test and needed to relevel. We then ran a couple more tests tweaking the level a bit each time and next thing you know the printer is working great.

Anyone can get this right it just takes a little patience. We get a piece of notebook thickness paper. Any paper will do just not really thick or thin. On your printer, you should have a bed leveling option or you can download the file from many places. What happens is the hot end goes around the four corners of the bed and lowers to the first layer height. You take your piece of paper and slide it between the tip of the hot end and the surface of the bed. First doing this I was constantly thinking how do I know what is correct? If you slide your paper in between and it gets stuck it’s too close. If you slide it in between and it doesn’t touch the tip you are too far. All you need to do is feel some drag and once you do make every point feel the same as that one and you are in great shape.

The biggest problem I have is remembering which way is up and which way is down and keep moving it the wrong way! Once I am past that all is good. I will stress here that going around as many times as you have to until you do not have to adjust any of the knobs. This is the important part. Once you have this you should be good to go!

##  Take Your Time!

One last note on leveling. I hear a lot about people constantly leveling their beds. If you have to do this something is wrong with it. I have one printer that I have had for a few years and only have leveled it twice. My ender has only been leveled when I set it up. It is still good a year later. Talking about the Ender there is a spring kit that I used which made the leveling of the bed 10 times easier. The original springs are very weak. It was like 8 bucks on Amazon.

If I missed anything you need to know please make a comment and Happy 3D Printing!
