# Lulzbot is now JohnBot

Another friendly neighborhood update on the Lulzbot AO 101 build. I am now calling this machine the JohnBot because of the Frankenstein way this is thrown together. It certainly is no longer a Lulzbot except for the motors, base frame, and bed carriage. Everything else has been modified or changed outright. I think I should go through what I am using on this machine. 

What I wanted out of this rebuild was more height. I added extrusions for the height. The way it was I only would get around 2 1/2"' but now it's around 12". I changed the motherboard to an SKR V4 Turbo. I replaced the power supply to be able to run 24 volts and that meant I had to change the bed for 24 volts also. I added an LCD screen to be able to control the printer without plugging it into a computer. I changed the z-axis and x-axis setup. I switched the lead screws which are actually a downgrade but work fine. the hot end is now a direct drive Creality set up.  

Through all these changes I had to model in Fusion 360 custom corner braces and other brackets plus the electronics holder and cover. I could find no models out there that would work. I did grab a few corner brackets and the LCD cover. I used a modified version of the Prusa Z carriages for mine.

\#\#Where are we now? 

 I am presently working through calibrating everything so I can get to that elusive first print. I am using TeachingTechs [awesome guide](https://teachingtechyt.github.io/index.html) for this. It has been a few months of messing with this build and I am ready for it to print. Wish me Luck!
