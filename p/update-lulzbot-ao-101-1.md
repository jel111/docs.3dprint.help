# Update: Lulzbot AO 101

I have made some progress on my Rehab of the [Lulzbot AO 101](https://www.lulzbot.com/learn/announcements/ao-101-here) - 2012 printer. Previously I ripped it all apart so I could increase the Z height to increase the width would be basically building a whole new machine. I had model up in Fusion 360 some new carriages and bracing to print and after that I also had to deal with the x-axis. I took the Prusa design of the carriages and modified those for the spacing of my rod and lead screw as well as using a 20/20 extrusion for the rail of the x-axis. I got lucky when modeling this in Fusion 360 and they worked the very first time![![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80a7397b-2aac-495a-8816-8cb02a6ab4d8_917x733.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80a7397b-2aac-495a-8816-8cb02a6ab4d8_917x733.jpeg)

## **On to the Electronics!**

The motherboard is the old 2012 Rambo v1.0 board and I am upgrading to the BigTreeTech SKR 1.4 turbo and the 2209 drivers. I found out from [Teaching Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbgBDBrwsikmtoLqtpc59Bw) on YouTube that you can use the Duet Web Control by installing RepRap firmware. What does this mean? It means that I will not use [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/) but [Duets](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/c/DuetWebControl) web interface which allows me to run the machine from an Amazon Fire tablet. I will still have to use a Raspberry Pi with the BigTreeTech board and that creates the wifi capabilities needed for Duet web control and can be used on any internet connected device. I should mention that Octoprint can as well it’s just not as capable in my opinion. That is for another post.

So where exactly have I gotten too? I am wiring up things as we speak while printing a plate to be attached the back of the printer. This plate will hold the Raspberry Pi and the motherboard. This morning I added all the different connectors I needed to go from the old to the new board and I also did some adjustments to the positioning of the hot end assembly in relationship to the bed. I believe it’s only close and will need some more adjusting. A few days ago I made some minor changes to the firmware and installed it just to check if things were working, so far so good. I know many more modifications will be needed to get things printing properly. Below is an example of the plate and how it will be attached.[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e851629-f1ad-4652-af09-39dbf9dfded2_1040x858.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e851629-f1ad-4652-af09-39dbf9dfded2_1040x858.jpeg)

I have gotten a long way in the last few weeks. I have had some set backs and days of just planning without anything being done to the mechanics of the printer. I had to work out how I wanted to route the wires and where I needed the boards to be. I went through 5 or 6 different iterations of an external case that housed the Pi, Motherboard, and a TFT screen. I decided against that for a few reasons the two largest are that I don’t really need a screen and I do not want the extra footprint. This printer is going into an enclosure on a shelf I made just for it.

Coming up in the next few weeks I plan onsetting all the mechanicals and electronics finished. I am just waiting on a power button and I am good to go. Once that is complete the hopefully painless process of getting the machine printing well. In the next update I hope I’ll be able to show off a print or two. Until then happy printing and if you need some help feel free to post a comment I look everyday. Thanks and have a great week from your 3d printing help home.
