# Articles

I will post articles from my [Free Weekly Newsletter](https://3dprint.substack.com) every week on here for you to browse. If you would like please subscribe on Substack and get my letter in your inbox every week. I do my best to address subjects everyone can relate to when starting out 3d printing. On occasion, I do go over some deeper topics as I build different types of printers or refurbish and upgrade/ungrade the ones I already have.

Keep on Printing!
