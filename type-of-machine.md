# Type of Machine

3D printing is gaining in popularity and one of the most rapidly growing technologies for the maker ecosystem. In the past few years, the hunt for an affordable 3D printer has become a type of space race.

How come there are such cost variances between 3d printer models? What makes this very confusing to us consumers is the myriad of materials and the different resolutions or print quality. ****Let's compare two of the most popular 3D Printing processes:

**Stereo-lithography \(SLA\) vs. Fused Deposition Modeling \(FDM\).**

**SLA vs. FDM**

**This is a quote from the dictionary for SLA:** Stereolithography is a form of 3D printing technology used for creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts in a layer by layer fashion using photochemical processes by which light causes chemical monomers and oligomers to cross-link together to form polymers. Those polymers then make up the body of a three-dimensional solid.

**Another quote from the dictionary for FDM**: Fused filament fabrication, also known under the trademarked term fused deposition modeling, sometimes also called filament freeform fabrication, is a 3D printing process that uses a continuous filament of a thermoplastic material. Filament is fed from a large spool through a moving, heated printer extruder head, and is deposited on the growing work. The print head is moved under computer control to define the printed shape.

We get all that but was does all that mean in laymen's terms? Simply I would explain both as messy and not messy. Just kidding although very true. SLA is printers use an LCD casting UV light which creates one whole layer at a time by dipping a platum into a liquid or more precisely photopolymer resin. Whereas an FDM printer uses a solid plastic forced through a heated nozzle thus melting it into a bead and stacking it into layers. Both processes take much longer than I think most expect. 

SLA printers are more expensive but in the last few years have come down in price allowing us Makers to get a hold of them. They are still more expensive due to the consumables and other equipment needed to produce usable prints. An FDM printer in the same amount of time has reduced their prices dramatically and one can get a reliable and decent printer for around $200 US.
