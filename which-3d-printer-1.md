Which 3d Printer should you get? It depends on many factors let’s try to address the main ones. I usually don't buy the newest shiny object I see. For the most part, I am frugal when it comes to most items except Apple products. I will admit I am a big fanboy. I bet you can determine from the previous couple of sentences what I'm going to write next. Buy the best value printer you can for your first foray down this rabbit hole. It’s an endless pit you just fell in!

 My first printer was a used older model, Lulzbot. It is a rock-solid expensive printer brand new. When I saw it for under a hundred dollars, I gave it a shot. I brought it home, tried to print, and got no-where. That is where the chase began, falling down a rabbit-hole of heated plastic.

 I wouldn’t suggest trying this route if you don’t like a challenge or tinkering. It was not easy trying to get that printer to print but I did learn a lot. In the end, I got it printing, and it worked for a few years. It may be a challenge to come by a good buy off of Craigslist or other sales sites but it may be worth a shot. Today printers are so cheap brand new that I don’t know if it would be worth the headache.

The moment you’ve been waiting for! The number one printer I recommend for anyone getting into 3d Printing is the Ender 3 Pro. You can pick this printer up for around $200 give or take a few bucks depending on who and when you buy it. You are probably asking yourself why. The first big reason is it comes almost fully assembled and ready to print. I would bet it will take most people around an hour or two to be up and printing their first model. This is huge because if most people can not see results fairly quickly they will not have a good experience and may never continue.

The second reason is that it prints really well right out of the box. I see a lot of posts on the net about the Ender being a terrible printer and I think it is just people who didn’t pay attention to details putting the machine together. The machine needs to be level and flat on the table plus the bed needs to be leveled properly. Once accomplished I think most will have a great experience.

The final reason is that a ton has been sold and there is a huge community behind this machine. Not only that Creality, the manufacturer, is a big player in the space, and if you have an issue it will most likely be resolved fairly quickly. I bought mine from their official site and got it in a few weeks from China.

I really can’t see myself recommending any other printer for the beginner except maybe the Prusa MK3 or the Prusa mini. They are great machines but the biggest problem with those is it takes a long time to get them because of backorders and they are much more expensive. I will only tell people to buy this one if they have the money to burn.

 Thanks for reading all the way to the end and if you have any questions don’t be shy and ask I will do my best to respond.
