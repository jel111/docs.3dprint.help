OctoPrint makes you wireless! Outside of all our joy in printing upgrades for our printers, the one thing that makes it even more enjoyable is going wireless. Saying wireless means sending a print from your computer to the machine without using the SD card or having to be plugged into USB. Here is a description quoted straight from their site: “_**OctoPrint**_ is the snappy web interface for your 3D printer that allows you to control and monitor all aspects of your printer and print jobs, right from your browser.”

## **Doesn’t that sound great!**

Octopirint is a software that we download to an SD card and then run that on a Raspberry Pi. I admit there are other ways to do this, but that starts getting more complicated. We want simple to set up and easy to get going. It is pretty painless. We need to download the Octopi image from Octoprint.org. Next, we need to add our user name and password from our WiFi router into the supplicant file. Unmount the card. We load the SD card into our Pi and then plug the Pi into the printer's USB port. Now we open a browser window from our computer on the same network as the Pi typing octopi.local. Typing this should bring up a prompt for the user name and password. We now should see Octoprint.[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ee65213-01f9-442b-9b4c-c5366feacc87_592x444.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ee65213-01f9-442b-9b4c-c5366feacc87_592x444.jpeg)

Once we have gotten this far like everything else in the 3d printing world we can change things to our heart’s content. Plug-ins are how we do that. Here is the link to the [plug-in page](https://plugins.octoprint.org/). Octoprint has so many plugins it’s possible to come away with something that looks nothing like the default start page. The first thing I would suggest to do is get a Pi camera. This allows us to view the print in real-time. I use this feature more than any other. I have tried adding a lot of different plug-ins but these days I just run it very simple. I do see tons of people using the time-lapse plug-in but I have never tried it. It does look very cool but I have no need.

I would like to mention the one downside is when things go wrong even though there is a huge community behind this it can be hard to fix if you are not savvy with the command line or Raspberry Pi software and hardware. I would bet over 90% of people will never need to worry about this and things will be fine but when you enter that ten percent it can get tough. Lately, I have been struggling with my simple one printer set up. It has been a week and I still can’t figure things out. I will state I am a beginner in the Pi world but do have some command-line coding experience. I am still having a very difficult time. Like with everything we just have to keep trying and things will get better.

If you have any questions at all feel free to ask I will do my best to answer them. Here are a few resources just in case. The Octoprint community [forum](https://community.octoprint.org/). A few YouTube channels: [Teachingtech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbgBDBrwsikmtoLqtpc59Bw), [Chep](https://www.youtube.com/user/beginnerelectronics), [Tom3D](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomasSanladerer) and you will find many more. Just search Octopi and your off! Thanks for your time and have fun!
