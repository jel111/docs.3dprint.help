Today let’s dive into how to get a print to stick to the bed for the entirety of the process. I think the most important factors are bed level, nozzle height, and then heat. In that order. There are other factors like speed or retraction as well but in a quick post, we won’t get into that today. Glue or hairspray is used by many but I rarely use either even on a glass bed. If you are having trouble you can use a glue stick spread evenly or hairspray on the bed after you clean it with some alcohol. This will work but I only use it as a last resort. People I know use this every time no matter what but I hate to clean up after the stuff. I have also seen a lot of Goo type stuff sold by 3d printing shops but I have never had the need to use it and can not give a recommendation.

In a previous post, I went into detail about bed leveling. Today I will just reiterate that it is a very important step. Go around leveling the bed until you hit all corners without having to make any adjustments. Do not skimp on this you will regret it later. It is important to not squish the first layer too much or not squish it enough. When you lay a pass down you should be able to run your finger across it perpendicularly and the pass shouldn’t break off. You should also feel a nice oval shape not really flat. If it is flat the bed is too close to the hot end and if the first pass moves it’s more than likely too far.

If the bed is not level front to back or side to side when you run your finger along you will feel a difference in the size of the pass. Either flat, round, or moving. You can adjust this on the fly if you want. Just make small increments till it feels right. There are files out there to make a leveling pass. Like this one from [Chep](https://www.chepclub.com/bed-level.html). Filament Friday is his channel and Chep has a lot of info on his site.

I think the next thing to worry about is heat. On the side of the filament roll, you’ll usually see a suggested temperature range. Most people start printing with PLA, actually, I recommend it. PLA is the easiest and most forgiving to print. Many set the heat around 190 to 210 I am at the high side of that. I was a welder for many years and I look at printing the same way. The longer I welded the hotter and faster I went. Granted 3d printing is different but similar at the same time. Slowly adjusting the temperature, either up or down, you can find the best temperature for your machine. Some machines are not accurate at the temp they show you so many times it is a trial by fire.

Most printers have a heated bed today and I would be surprised if anyone with a newer printer didn’t have one. For PLA I keep the bed around 80 degrees. It is said in almost every blog I read or video I watch that 60 degrees should be the temperature used. Now my printers might be wrong as I have never tested them but it’s what I use. As with the hot end setting it can be a trial and error, what works best for you.

I think this should be a good starting point for you to hit the ground running and get a first quality print. If you are having trouble feel free to leave a comment and let me know what is happening and how I can help. I will do my best.
