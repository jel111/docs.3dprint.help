# Why 3D Printing

I would like, with my first post here on Substack, to address the question of what one is getting into when they start down the road of 3D Printing with a starter machine. We have an unimaginable amount of different printers to choose from, and I think it’s important to note a few things that caught me off guard when I decided to go down this road.

The statements will be for someone, like me, who is purchasing what I call an inexpensive novice machine. I will use the majorly popular Ender 3 as our model starter machine.

The Ender 3 Pro, which is version two of the original Ender by Creality, is around $220 US dollars as of this moment and when I purchased one. This machine goes together easily. Do not rush through this step! It is important to take your time and make sure the printer is sitting solidly on the table, square, and the bed leveled properly. I went around the bed multiple \(5-6\) times leveling before I was satisfied. The pro version has most of the bugs ironed out, and you should be able to be up and printing in a matter of an hour. You are supplied a small amount of filament, and an SD-Card with a few models on it sliced and ready to print. If you have a few models on your computer and the software to parse or, what we call Slice, the models which convert them into a language the printer can read and execute, you are ahead of the game. If you have a roll of filament on hand, your model, and the machine set up, you are ready and will be printing straight ahead.

##  _**It takes a Looong time!**_

The first thing that was a bit of a shock to me is how long it takes to print a model. It takes a loooong time. We are talking hours, not a few minutes. There are a few test prints \(models\) on the card supplied to get you off, and printing and those are somewhat quick but still an hour or two. Patience is the key to having and using a 3D Printer.

The second thing, once the initial rush wore off unless you have 3D modeling under your belt, anything but simple models will cost you. Albeit most models are very cheap and worth it, but it is worth mentioning. It seems like one should intuitively know this, but I did not. Another note on models is all of them can't be printed on your machine. There are many factors for this, but for now, just be aware of this fact.

We cannot print every type of filament \(plastic\) with a starter machine such as the Ender. In my opinion, you should stick with PLA for a while until you get the hang of the software and are getting consistent quality prints that do not fail. You will have failures! It’s part of the game, do not be discouraged and use them as a learning tool. It is possible to print all kinds of different types of filaments on this machine but not as it comes from the factory. A stock machine needs upgrading, it can not print flexible and other types of filaments. The upgrade could simply be a different type of nozzle, very cheap, or maybe a new hot end and extruder. The extruder upgrade can be reasonably inexpensive or could run $50 or so. The hot-end ranges in price from manageable to crazy. A lot of these upgrades, as well as others, will require things to be changed on the printer. Find a site or YouTuber that you like and trust to get the proper information. Hopefully, my page can be a go-to spot for you in the future.

I am not, in this posting, going deep into these areas of upgrading or modifying your printer or how to print with different filaments or print different things. The how-tos and why’s will come in future postings, for now, I want to do a high-level overview of what we are doing. I do not remember ever seeing a blog post or article on this topic and am trying to rectify that here. We are close to the finish line.

##  _**You Don’t have to Upgrade!**_

I think it necessary to state big and bold, “YOU DO NOT HAVE TO UPGRADE!” I think the bulk of the postings and articles about 3d printing are on how to upgrade your printer, and it gets ingrained in us that this is what we must do. We do not have to improve our printers! I repeat it to drive home the point. If you are anything like me, this seems like the whole reason and the fun part, but I would implore you to get your printer up and running and printing. Get quality prints with few failures before you think about upgrades. At this point, you should have an excellent grasp of things and what you want to accomplish with 3d printing. I didn’t know what to print after the initial first few. I only knew that it looked so freaking cool, and I wanted to be cool! Upgrading can become an addiction getting out of hand quickly. My Ender 3 has only two minor upgrades and prints awesome. The upgrades are just better parts that come stock but cheap from the manufacturer, and I had to replace them. A simple $20 upgrade of the springs for the bed and an extruder switched from a plastic one to a metal one. I think the machines shipped now come with these stock. It prints so well that I can’t bring myself to change it.

I will say that I am doing everything in my power not to go hog wild and change things. I do have an older Lulzbot I picked up used and will be upgrading that. I will be bringing you all along on that process. I still can’t bring myself to mess with the Ender 3 Pro because it prints so well.

One thing I would like to address before I close this out is the Slicer that you use may make a difference and has a learning curve. I bought my first machine used and tried with Cura to get a decent print, and I couldn’t. I didn’t know how or what to set because I was a newb, and many things could be set differently from the pre-populated settings. I then purchased Simplify 3d with it’s presets and got a great print right away. S3D is expensive, but I had paid so little for that machine it was worth every penny. Every situation is different, but if you are struggling and have the money, I would look into it. I am not telling anyone to buy S3D I am just letting you know what helped me.

I am wrapping this up! I think the main take away should be to know what you want to print first and don’t make any changes to your printer until you are getting consistently good prints. Of course, if you get a bad machine, you have to fix it. Take your time learning how so you can make a quality decision on what upgrades are worth your time and money. Many things seem like the answer only later to find out it doesn’t help.

I hope you have gotten a cursory idea of the journey you are about to embark. I think of the saying, “Going down the rabbit hole” is a perfect way to describe my foray into 3D Printing. Thank you for reading and have fun! Come back soon or subscribe to see what’s next for this newsletter!
